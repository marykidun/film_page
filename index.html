          <h2>The Valet</h2>
          <p class="film-description">
            The Valet (French: La Doublure, lit.â€‰'The Stand-In') is a 2006
            comedy film written and directed by Francis Veber and starring Gad
            Elmaleh, Alice Taglioni, Daniel Auteuil and Kristin Scott Thomas.
            The film is about a parking valet who is enlisted to pretend to be
            the lover of a famous fashion model in order to deflect attention
            from her relationship with a married businessman. The film enjoyed
            box office success in France and the United States.[3][4] The Valet
            was remade as the 2009 Hindi film Do Knot Disturb, which in turn
            inspired the 2014 Punjabi film Disco Singh and the 2016 Bengali
            movie Haripad Bandwala. An English-language remake, The Valet, was
            released on 20 May 2022 by Hulu.

          <h2>Overboard</h2>
          <p class="film-description">
            Overboard is a 1987 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry
            Marshall, written by Leslie Dixon, starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt
            Russell,[3] and produced by Roddy McDowall, who also co-stars. The
            film's soundtrack was composed by Alan Silvestri. Although it opened
            to mixed reviews and was a box-office disappointment, Overboard has
            become a cult film and has been remade several times. In 1992, it
            was adapted in the Indian film Ek Ladka Ek Ladki, in 2006, it was
            adapted into the South Korean television series Couple or Trouble,
            and in 2018 it was remade with Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez. The
            plot of the 1997 Malayalam film Mayaponman, is loosely based on this
            film.
